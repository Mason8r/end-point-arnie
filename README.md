End Point Arnie
---------------
Needed to test an webhook online, current system was only local, current proof of concept to see if its feasible to make a public endpoint that spits out the payload request and headers of every post / put / delete.

### TODO
- Store requests in the file without HTML and add that in a template after
- Add bootstrap or something to make the HTML bit a little quicker
